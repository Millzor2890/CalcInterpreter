Calculus Interpreter and Graph plotter

This was one of my earlier CS projects and if you run the TestFunctions1,java it will plot a few example functions for you using text and a Turtle Plotter.  This particular project really helped me gain an in depth experience with OO Programming, and I think that plotting calc functions is neat!
